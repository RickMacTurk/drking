                        Electronic refill requests may take up to 72 hours to be complete. However prescriptions will approved as soon as possible, usually by the next business day.
                        If you have a problem getting your prescription, please call our office during normal business hours.
                        In general, all patients are required to be current patients seen within the last 6 months to get a phone or auto refill. However, some patients may require labs or an office visit more frequently.

                            <li>Controlled substances (pain, sleep, muscle relaxants, stimulants, anti-depressants) are tracked by the Drug Monitoring Program (PMP).

                            <li>New patients who request a controlled substance for acute pain may receive one prescription of pain medication or controlled substance (at the discretion of the physician) after a PMP report is obtained.</li>
