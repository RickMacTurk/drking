                                Susan King started practicing in Austin in 2001. She opened her practice at 12 Oaks Medical Center in January 2002. 
                                Dr. King practiced there until she moved to her current Cypress Creek location in October 2009. 
                                Her practice started by working in close proximity to her father’s family medical practice; Dr. David King and Dr. Humberto Enriquez. 
                                She built her practice one patient at a time to what it is today. Many referrals came from both Dr. David King (retired 2004) and Dr. Enriquez (retired 2007) as well as many of the surrounding physicians. 
                                The guidance and mentoring from her Father and Dr. Enriquez was invaluble in helping Susan build her practice.
                                Originally from St. Johns, Newfoundland Canada, Dr. King came to Austin in 1983 with her family. She completed her degree in Electrical Engineering in 1987 from the university of Toronto. 
                                She worked as an engineer for 6 years while simultaneously preparing and studying for entry to medical school.
                                In 1993 Susan was accepted into medical school at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She completed her MD and a residency in Family practice in 1999. 
                                Dr. King worked as an ER physician and as a Locum Tenens in Family medicine  for 2 years before moving to Austin with her husband in the fall of 2000.
                                On first arriving to Austin, she worked as an urgent care physician and at a community MAP clinic in Jonestown before starting her own practice in the fall of 2001
                                Dr. King and her husband live in Cedar Park and have 2 children. In her spare time she enjoys running and strength training at Gold’s Gym. 
                                She also enjoys baking and doing crafts and spending time with her children.
