                            <p>Even if you feel fine, it is still important for your doctor to regularly check for potential problems. Most people who have high blood pressure don’t even know it. The only way to find out is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Likewise, high blood sugar and high cholesterol levels often do not produce any symptoms until the disease becomes advanced.</p>
                            <p>There are specific times when you should see your health care provider. Age-specific guidelines are as follows:</p>
                            <div class="main-section bold-700">Blood Pressure Screening</div>
                            <p>Have your blood pressure checked every year.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If the top number (systolic number) is greater than 130 or the bottom number (diastolic number) is greater than 85, call your doctor.</p>
