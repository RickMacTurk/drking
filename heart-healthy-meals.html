                                <li>Use low-fat methods and remember not to add butter or high fat sauces—Bake, broil, microwave, roast, steam, poach, lightly stir fry or sauté in cooking spray, small amount of vegetable oil, or reduced sodium broth, grill seafood, chicken, or vegetables.</li>
                                <li>Use a nonstick (without added fat) or regular (with small amount of fat) pan.</li>

                                <li>Instead of sour cream, blend 1 cup low-fat, unsalted cottage cheese with 1 tablespoon fat-free milk and 2 tablespoons lemon juice, or substitute fat-free or low-fat sour cream or yogurt.</li>

                                <li>Choose margarine that lists liquid vegetable oil as the first ingredient on the food label and is low in saturated fat and low in or free of trans fat.</li>

                                <li>Remove fat from homemade broths, soups, and stews by preparing them ahead and chilling them. Before reheating the dish, lift off the hardened fat that formed at the surface. If you don’t have time to chill the dish, float a few ice cubes on the surface of the warm liquid to harden the fat.

                                <li>When making muffins or quick breads, use three ripe, very well-mashed bananas, instead of 1/2 cup butter or oil. Or substitute a cup of applesauce for a cup of butter, margarine, oil, or shortening—you’ll get less saturated fat and fewer calories.</li>
