                            A high fiber diet is essential for digestive tract health at all ages. Highly refined foods and low fiber diets can increase the time it takes for your body to eliminate waste or have a bowel movement. Daily bowel movements indicate a health digestive tract with a “short transit time”. Many people are unable to achieve this and this can lead to feeling unwell, abdominal pain, hemorrhoids, fissures and bleeding.

                            <span class="bold-700">Fiber:</span> What is it? Fiber is the indigestible portion of all the plant derived food we eat including fruit, vegetables, grains and legumes.

                            How does it promote regularity? Fiber creates softer more bulky stools that are easier to pass by absorbing water. Fiber also promotes digestive tract contractions that help food move more quickly through your colon. To maximize the benefit of fiber it is essential to drink plenty of water. It is recommended to drink 64 fluid oz of water per day.
