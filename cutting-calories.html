                            <p>Most people try to reduce their calorie intake by focusing on food, but another way to cut calories may be to change what you drink. You may find that you’re consuming quite a few calories just in the beverages you have each day. Drinking juices, smoothies , sweet teas and sodas and alcohol can add up to cause weight gain. Dr. King recommends drinking water, black coffee or tea without sugar. Even diet sodas can trick our bodies into gaining weight.</p>

                            <p>You may find that your portion sizes are leading you to eat more calories than you realize. Research shows that people unintentionally consume more calories when faced with larger portions. This can mean excessive calorie intake, especially when eating high-calorie foods and snacks.</p>
